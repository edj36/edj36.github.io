- read 12 books (last year I was a bit too optimistic, however to my defense, I do a lot of my reading on an exercise bike in my gym and I wasn't able to do that after the pandemic)
- average 4 workouts/week
- run 500 miles total
- maintain or decrease current weight (175 lbs)
- continue or increase all automated saving/investing contributions I have in place
    - 401k, high yield savings, dollar cost averaging to index fund
- make a new investment in an income producing asset
