Last year a lot of my goals were outcome driven, this year I want to be more process driven and my goals reflect that.

- 20 books (process is to read about 2 books/month with some wiggle room)
- average 3.5 workouts/week (I am tracking days I work out)
- max contributions to my 401k (using automatic contributions every paycheck)
- continue dollar cost averaging and automatic savings (this is in place, goal really is to not need to stop doing it)
- maintain current weight (mainly stay under 180 lbs, this should be a side effect of doing 3.5 workouts/week)
