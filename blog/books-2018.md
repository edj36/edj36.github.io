At the beginning of 2018, my resolution was to read 12 books and write about them. I hit my goal of 12, but didn't suceed in writing about every book I read. I'm happy with this result, but still am reminded I have lots of room to grow and improve in 2019. I'm looking forward to reading more books in the coming year, and writing more as well. Happy new year!
