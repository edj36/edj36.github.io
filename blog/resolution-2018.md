title: 2018 Resolution

In 2018 I want to commit to reading and writing more. I already read regularly and write occasionally, but most of my reading comes from random articles on Twitter or HackerNews. I want to make my writing and reading more focused. I am going to commit to reading something substantial (a book, a paper, a journal, etc.) and working to write a detailed review/reaction/summary each month of 2018. So next December I should have 12 books under my belt and 12 detailed articles about the corresponding books that you could read here on this site. Reading an entire book on a topic (instead of a short article online) will push me to get a deeper understanding, and writing should help me to get better at formalizing and expressing thoughts in my head and things I have learned from my reading. I am writing this post to timestamp my goal. If anyone is reading this and wants to join me in my monthly goal of reading and writing, let me know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/EJ96) and we could follow each other's progress throughout the year. Check back each month to see if I have been able to keep up with my resolution. Happy new year!
