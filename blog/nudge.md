My thoughts and ideas after reading Nudge by Thaler (link here)

What is a nudge?

- some nudge examples
- some things they are good at, bad at 

common implementations:
RECAP
placing

ideas for places that could use a nudge 
college class scheduling
college applications (touched on in the book) 
career fairs?

online personal data
	regulations that include nudges so people understand how their data is used online and how it can effect them
