# Background
***
Seth Klarmin (Cornell 79, Harvard 82) is the founder and leader of the Baupost Group. He is wildly successful and regarded as among the great investors of his generation. I am reading a copy of his book *Margin of Safety* and will keep notes and thoughts about it here.


# Introduction
***
- long term investments based on underlying business fundamentals
- historial ebb and flow of investor sentiment between greed and fear
- There is nothing esoteric about value investing. It is simply the process of determining the value underlying a security and then buying it at a considerable discount from that value. It is really that simple.
