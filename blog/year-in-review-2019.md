Copy goals here, and show which ones I hit and which ones I did not.

Review:

Generally a good year. Had ups and downs but ended positively I think. Got promoted and a raise which was good (now time to hedge lifestyle inflation). Dealt with deaths, impending death (hospice), and mental health issues in family, which I haven't fully processed yet, but I think will bring my family together and help us grow - still sucks tho. Felt spread thin at work/hedonistically trying to improve my life. It's so hard to balance workism and the like. Need to focus more and then dive deep this year. The problem is getting something good to focus on, if that makes sense. Going to do everything I can this year to make it so that I have good opportunities to dive into, not things I half-ass while waiting for better options.

Huge change for me this year was losing (almost) 50 pounds and really shifting my lifestyle. I think I am more confident overall because of this, feel better about myself, and have more confidence in my ability to reach other goals as well. I'm really happy people supported me in this, and that I was able to see that goal through the end.

I wanted to include a note about simplicity. I feel a un-ending need to simplify aspects of my life, have less apps, less commitment (like groups/events to attend), less stuff, etc. I think this is valuable right now for me, in that my most valuable asset is my brain, and the more I am able to let if focus on *important* things, the better. Am I the right person to judge importance? Probably not, but can't get better at that without trying.

I am really excited about sports/analytics/gambling space. Also really excited about the real estate space. I don't get so excited about machine learning. I do get excited about building/internalizing robust data driven processes, that we can use to leverage/upend existing systems. What I am trying to say is that I don't want to solve a problem (e.g. betting on hockey) with machine learning for the sake of being an ML guy, but I want to get good at understanding the data, the math, and some coding to be able to leverage those tools to make good decisions, insights. I think this is the future and I want to be on top of this wave.
