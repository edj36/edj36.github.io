<p>Want a side business that is - as passive as possible - provides stream of income to me - should be through an LLC to make safe - can do any with a group/partners or by yourself, but need initial capital to get it off the ground</p>
<p>Ideas: - rental property (vacation, apartments, homes) - own a condo (in nyc building) and rent it - parking lot - buy a specific parking space and then rent it out - school campus rental property - laundromat - investmentsâ€¦ - dry cleaner (hire staff) - organize hamptons trips for finance people (this is not a very passive stream) - write a book and reap profits - affiliate links on popular blog - youtube/twitch viewers - patent and license tech - write Saas product that you can sell/maintain close to passively - loan people money? - convenience stores/delis - taxi medallions or the like - franchises (taco bell/subway) - niche skills you can consult on - scrape web data (automated) and sell it to hedge funds - sell data based on your side businesses - buy non-performing loans and get the people to pay them off - bet on sports, sell reliable bet predictions</p>
