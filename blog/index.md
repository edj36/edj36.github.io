# Notes

Below are notes (some PDFs some HTML) from classes I have taken or books I have read. Notes from classes were not assigned work, I created them to review material learned in class in an organized way.

- [Chapter summaries](algo_chapter_summaries.pdf) from [CS 4820 - Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4820/2017fa/)
- [Machine learning review sheet](ml_final_review.pdf) for [ECE 4950 - Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/acharya/teaching/ece4950s17/ece4950) at Cornell
