Want a side business that is 
- as passive as possible
- provides stream of income to me
- should be through an LLC to make safe
- can do any with a group/partners or by yourself, but need initial capital to get it off the ground

Ideas:
- rental property (vacation, apartments, homes)
- own a condo (in nyc building) and rent it
- parking lot
- buy a specific parking space and then rent it out
- school campus rental property
- laundromat
- investments...
- dry cleaner (hire staff)
- organize hamptons trips for finance people (this is not a very passive stream)
- write a book and reap profits
- affiliate links on popular blog
- youtube/twitch viewers
- patent and license tech
- write Saas product that you can sell/maintain close to passively
- loan people money?
- convenience stores/delis
- taxi medallions or the like
- franchises (taco bell/subway)
- niche skills you can consult on 
- scrape web data (automated) and sell it to hedge funds 
- sell data based on your side businesses
- buy non-performing loans and get the people to pay them off
- bet on sports, sell reliable bet predictions
