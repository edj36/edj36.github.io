Over the course of my winter break from school, I want to investigate how tweets on [Twitter](twitter.com) affect stocks in the stock market. My interest in this topic stems from a paper BOLLEN et al HERE, on the topic. It would be really cool to prove that tweets do effect prices of companies listed in different markets, but also interesting to find out why they do not. 

This is what I plan on investigating. In order to do this, I am going to aggregate tweets from Twitter and perform natural language processing on them. From data I produce, I will see if I can correlate a stock's rise and fall to tweets and the sentiment generated from them. It should be fun.
