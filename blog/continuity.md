Random thought on continuity.

Feeling I like is using a product (i.e. a razor or shaving cream) until its done and then going out and buying the exact same version of something and using that, like in a cycle. Not sure why but I really like it when this happens (Clark's shoes, etc.).

I think I like it because I like the contiuity. I like that I have my own place (not volatile school changing all the time) I have routines and I found quality stuff I like. I find joy in that stability and cycle of usage (even though its just shaving cream). When I do these recurring purchases, I feel like I've "solved" a piece of the puzzle that is life. I'm not going and trying to test out new shaving creams anymore. I can automatically just buy what I always get and move on to more interesting things. I like when I am at a point like this for most products. It helps me stay focused mentally on things I care about. I want to devote brain power to what I consider my core competency (not boring stuff) and with the stability and continuity mentioned above, I am more able to do that. Don't have to ever research a new soap, just get the usual and move on. Getting like this for some shoes, potentially suits, dry cleaning, deodorant, razors, etc.
