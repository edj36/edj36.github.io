Hi, my name is Eric Johnson. I am a senior at Cornell studying electrical and computer engineering. I am interested in a wide array of subjects, including, but not limited to signal processing, networks, functional programming, and pattern recognition. I am also minoring in computer science and have some professional experience with software development.

### Current Work
- Live dashboard of daily MLB [scores](https://edj36.github.io/mlb-dashboard/)
    - NOTE: you need to "enable unsafe scripts" to allow the Javascript to actually load the scores
- Bachelor's degree at [Cornell](https://www.cornell.edu)
- DIY personal cloud with Raspberry Pi and a portable hard drive (blog post coming soon)
